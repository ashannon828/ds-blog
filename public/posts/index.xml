      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the very beginning. What is synthetic data, and why do we even need it? In simple words, synthetic data is just thatâ€”synthetic or fake data created to make some task easier. Common use cases include masking sensitive data so that it can be shared, simulating events like fraudulent transactions, using dummy data to help with quality assurance, and many more.
In my case, I needed dummy data to test a database I was developing and Faker is my go to python library for that.</description>
