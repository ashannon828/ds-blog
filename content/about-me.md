# Hey, I'm Andrew ðŸ‘‹

I grew up in a small town in Maine, USA and graduated from Florida Atlantic University with a degree in management information systems. I'm currently working on my Masters degree in data science.

I enjoy the process of creating things from nothing, so I thought I wanted to be a front-end developer. I embarked on a multiyear journey to teach myself a modern front-end framework to get to the point that I could build websites like this spiffy blog you're reading now.

The funny part is I found UX writing, which showed me I didn't need to be a dev to use my creativity and contribute to a product team. It only took me 18 months working as a UX writer at Wix and working 6 months as a front-end developer to realize this.

In my free time, I enjoy producing music, tinkering with code, cooking, reading about content design, and exploring my new city, Houston, Texas.
